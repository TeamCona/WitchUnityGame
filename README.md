# WitchUnityGame

For this project, we will be creating a game using unity in c sharp. It will be a 2d game made using our own assests.

The game will consist of a witch who makes potions for various customers. A customer will go to the front desk and request a potion. The witch will then move to the room containing the ingredients and select the correct one to make the potion. The potion will be created and the witch will be tipped depending on how well the potion was made.
